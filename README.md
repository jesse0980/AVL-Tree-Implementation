# AVL-Tree-Implementation
This is an implementation of a self-balancing AVL tree from scratch. 
The input method is the console and it takes in commands to insert students into the tree which are inserted in postions based on their student IDs. 
You can insert, remove, and search IDs in O(logn) time.
